# Telemator

Remote control SqueezeBox, Kodi with your pebble

The idea is to have a single app for pebble that cans remote control a lot of other applications.
When you launch the app, it will automatically detect, for example if Kodi is start, and give you a display to control Kodi.

#but...
May be it will be better to use Tasker with AutoPebble and let your phone decide which app to launch on your pebble.
So you have to automatic thing with kinda a single app and with a advanced remote control app for your pebble.
I will see...
